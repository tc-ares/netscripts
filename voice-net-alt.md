*(Choose a method: by call sign suffix, short-time stations first, mobile, or emergency power, etc.)*

**Log Check-Ins**  
- Check with your backup NCS periodically to verify the count.  
- Handle doubles and incomplete transmissions as needed.  
- Once check-ins slow or stop, continue script.

## Notes

### During the Net

- Identify with your call sign **at least every 10 minutes**.  
- If conditions deteriorate on the main frequency, move to the backup frequency. Ensure your backup goes with you. Repeat the start of the script on the new frequency.

### During Check-Ins

- If there are **duplicates** (doubles), ask operators to repeat themselves until everyone is checked in.  
- If you hear a phone tone, the user may have **Yaesu WIRES** turned on. Ask them to disable WIRES and repeat their check-in.  
- If someone is inaudible:
  - Suggest they move to a higher location  
  - Increase power  
  - Switch to an antenna with more gain  
  - Try again
- Give signal reports to stations that are weak or scratchy.  
- “Short time” operators may request to leave right after check-in. You may say “You are released” or “You are released at your discretion.”
