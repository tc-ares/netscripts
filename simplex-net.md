# SIMPLEX Voice Net Control Script

---

## Before Starting

1. **Contact or appoint your Backup Net Control Station.**  
   - Ask your backup for a signal report and give them one as well.

2. **Check Frequency**  
   > "Is the frequency in use?"

---

## Opening the Net

1. **Begin the Net**  
   > "Calling the Austin/Travis County Amateur Radio Emergency Service net.  
   > This is [call sign] [name], Net Control.  
   > Back-up Net Control is [call sign] [name]."

2. **Nature of the Net**  
   > "This is an experimental net.  
   > If this experiment proves to be a success, we will conduct the SIMPLEX net on a regular basis."

3. **Frequencies**  
   > "This net is operating **SIMPLEX on 146.460 MHz** with NO TRANSMIT OFFSET and NO TONE.  
   > Our backup frequency is **SIMPLEX 146.500 MHz**, NO TRANSMIT OFFSET, NO TONE."

4. **Net Purpose**  
   > "The purpose of this net is training in emergency communications and the dissemination of pertinent information.  
   > The purpose of using SIMPLEX MODE is to provide training in the event that we are not able to use a repeater."

5. **ARES Role**  
   > "This net promotes public service through amateur radio. We provide emergency communications through agreements with several agencies in Travis County, Texas.  
   > The Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) is part of the Field Organization of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).  
   > This is a local level net of the ARRL National Traffic System."

6. **Net Control Authority**  
   > "This is a **directed net**. Please follow the instructions of net control.  
   > Please stay on frequency until released by net control."

## Special Notes for Simplex

> **PLEASE REMEMBER THAT WE ARE OPERATING WITHOUT THE AID OF A REPEATER.**  
> You will probably not hear all of the radio operators, and Net Control may not hear some either.  
> Please listen carefully at all times. Any time you may be requested to aid operators who cannot be heard by Net Control.  
> If Net Control fails to hear an operator and you are instructed to help, please transmit **"RELAY"**, release your PTT Button for a moment, then transmit your callsign.  
> When directed, you will be asked to relay the other operator’s message.  
> We ask all operators who check-in to **listen carefully at all times** during the operation of this net because of the **delicate nature of simplex operation**.  
> We also ask all operators to have **pen and paper** ready to **record all traffic** and **assist whenever requested** by Net Control.

## Priority Traffic

1. **Call for Priority Traffic**  
   > "Is there any priority traffic for this ARES net?"

   - Handle any priority traffic **immediately**.

---

## Announcements

1. **Call for Announcements**  
   > "Are there any stations with announcements for the net?  
   > Please wait to be recognized before giving your announcement."

2. **Gather Announcement Subjects**  
   > [Wait for calls]  
   > "[Call sign], what is the subject **only** of your announcement?"

   - If the station gives the entire announcement instead of just the subject, politely correct them.  
   - Decide if the announcement should be handled now or after the net.

3. **Repeat**  
   - Repeat the above process to handle all announcements.

---

## Other Business & Liaison Stations

1. **Call for Other Business**  
   > "Is there any other business for this net?"

2. **Liaison Stations**  
   > "Are there any liaison stations wishing to take outgoing traffic to other nets?"  
   - Check in and acknowledge all liaison stations.

3. **Traffic for the Net**  
   > "Is there any traffic for this ARES net?"  
   - Check in and **dispatch traffic**.  
   - Route any traffic listed. NCS can direct stations to another repeater or simplex frequency to pass traffic, depending on load.  
   - Suggest all stations listen and copy along for practice.

## ARES Officers' Business

> "Do we have any business from ARES officers?"  
> "Are there any other stations with business for the net?"

   > If unexpected events mean you must leave before the end of the net, please ask Net Control for permission to leave."

2. **Leave Gaps**  
   > "Please **leave a short gap** before each transmission, so that stations with EMERGENCY or PRIORITY traffic can be recognized."

## Notes to Net Control Stations

- This script is a **guideline**. You are free to adjust it as needed or try out improvements.  
- We do want to **generally follow the script** as written, so people train to use a consistent set of net practices.  
- We’d like our regular nets to help participants **automatically fall into good net procedures** during a real emergency net.
