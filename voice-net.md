### Notes
		
**During the net:**

- Remember to identify using your call sign, at least every 10 minutes.
- If conditions are bad on the main frequency, switch to the backup frequencies as needed. When switching, ensure your backup has moved with you before you begin. Repeat the start of the script on the new frequency. 

**During check-ins:**

- If there are duplicates, ask the operators to repeat themselves as needed until everyone is checked in. Queue them up using any partial call signs heard, if possible.
- If you hear a phone tone, the user may have Yaesu WIRES turned on. Ask them to turn it off and repeat their check-in.
- If someone just breaks squelch on the repeater but cannot be heard, ask the operator to try to:
  - Move to a higher location
  - Increase their power
  - Switch to an antenna with more gain
  - And then try to check in again.
- Give signal reports to stations that are weak, scratchy, or unclear.
- “Short time” operators are asking to leave the net directly after their check-in. The usual responses are “you are released” or “you are released at your discretion.”
